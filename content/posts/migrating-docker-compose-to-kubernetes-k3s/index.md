In this post, we will look at migrating Docker Compose run services to K3s, a lightweight version of Kubernetes. 

K3s provides an approachable way to experience Kubernetes. It is quick to spin up and takes care of a lot of boilerplate, which suits a test environment. We can work our way up to full Kubernetes (K8s) in the future.

We will continue using this site as an example and build upon the [previous post]({{< ref "/posts/self-hosted-website-with-hugo-docker-and-cloudflare-tunnels/index.md" >}} "Self-Hosted Website with Hugo, Docker, and Cloudflare Tunnels") which got our [GitHub repo to here.](https://github.com/alexdarbyshire/alexdarbyshire.com/tree/b468af84c2b2473776549cbba7d3238541556ce2)

## What is Kubernetes and where does it fit with Docker?
- **Kubernetes, Docker Swarm** Container orchestration tools that automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerised applications across multiple nodes (machines).
- **Rancher, Openshift, Portainer** Container management platforms that provide interfaces for interacting with Container Orchestration Tools.
- **Docker Compose** A tool for managing multi-container applications on a single node or within a Docker Swarm.
- **Docker** A tool for building images, interacting with image registries, and running containers.

Kubernetes allows containers to be scaled for huge audiences and to be scaled back down when the need reduces. Think Netflix at 8pm, Amazon on Black Friday, or Google when we are all searching as one.

Google gets a special mention having developed Kubernetes and open-sourced it in the first place. 

Note, Docker Swarm is included the above for historical reasons, its usage is waning. 

The major cloud service providers offer their own abstracted versions of Kubernetes. We are started with operating Kubernetes using the command line as it is usually helpful to understand what is going on beneath the hood with complex systems.

## Tech Stack
- **K3s**
- **Ubuntu Linux**
- **Docker**
- **Kompose** - open-source tool for converting Docker Compose definitions to Kubernetes resources
- **Distribution** - private container registry

## Bring Your Own
- **Host running Ubuntu Linux**
  - e.g. VirtualBox VM, Bare metal host, Virtual Private Server (VPS), WSL2  
- **Docker** -- installed on host
    - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
    - [Install Docker with convenience script](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script)

## Steps
### Install K3s and Kompose
[K3s Quick Start for reference](https://docs.k3s.io/quick-start)
#### Install K3s 

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```
![image](1-install-k3s.png)

#### Confirm K3s node creation
```bash
sudo k3s kubectl get node
```
![image](2-check-k3s-node-ready.png)
We can see it is ready by the roles including `control-plane` and `master`.

#### Install Kompose
```bash
sudo snap install kompose
```
![image](3-install-kompose.png)

### Convert Docker Compose to Manifests
#### Convert with Kompose
```bash
kompose convert
```
![image](4-kompose-convert.png)
Hmm... That was easy, almost too easy. Let's be gung-ho, not check what the output looks like and see if the new manifests work.

Links to the outputted files for reference:
- [cloudflared-deployment.yaml](cloudflared-deployment.yaml)
- [nginx-hugo.yaml](nginx-hugo-deployment.yaml)

#### Try out and debug Kompose generated manifests
Ask kubectl to apply the configuration files in the current folder.
```bash
sudo k3s kubectl apply -f .
```
![image](5-apply-kompose-manifests.png)

It threw an error for one of the three files being the docker-compose.yml. It doesn't know how to parse it as it is not a Kubernetes manifest. Fair.

Check the status of the resources.
```bash
sudo k3s kubectl get deployment.apps
```
![image](6-check-resources-created-from-kompose.png)

Ok, neither of our resources are available. Time to hit the logs.

```bash
sudo k3s kubectl logs deployment.app/hugo-nginx
sudo k3s kubectl logs deployment.app/cloudflared
```
![image](7-check-logs.png)

In the above output we discover:
1. The hugo-nginx image is not available to K3s. In the last post we built the image and access it via Docker's local image storage which K3s doesn't know how to access.
2. Cloudflared is missing its token.

```bash
cat cloudflared-deployment.yaml
```
![image](8-view-cloudflared-deployment.png)

We need to: 
- spin up a private registry for images and push our images (or push them to someone else's),
- pass our token into K3s using secrets, and
- add a Kubernetes service manifest for nginx-hugo. Kompose did not have sufficient info to tell that cloudflared needed to connect to nginx-hugo and as a result there is no service manifest to enable this.

### Create and Populate Private Image Registry 
We are creating the registry using K3s. This is not the easiest way to create a registry. To spin one up using Docker for a single host would require one command.  

First we will create a subdirectory called deploy for housing our K3s manifests.
```bash
mkdir deploy
cd deploy
```

Then, we add a file named `distribution.yaml` with the following contents: 
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: registry
  name: registry
spec:
  containers:
  - image: registry:2
    name: registry
    volumeMounts:
    - name: volv
      mountPath: /var/lib/registry
    ports:
     - containerPort: 5000
  volumes:
    - name: volv
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: local-path-pvc

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: registry
  name: registry
spec:
  ports:
  - name: "5000"
    port: 5000
    targetPort: 5000
  selector:
    app: registry
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Add another file called `distribution-pvc.yaml` with contents:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: local-path-pvc
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: local-path
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 4Gi
```

These files define two resources for running a private registry, and a local storage volume. Local storage isn't aligned with the Kubernetes approach, however it will suit our test usage. 


Note, this setup does not include authentication so should not be exposed on untrusted networks.

#### Bring up the registry
```bash
sudo k3s kubectl apply -f deployment-pvc.yml
sudo k3s kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

#### Re-tag and then push the images to the registry using Docker
```bash
docker image tag homelab/alexdarbyshire-site:3 localhost:5000/alexdarbyshire-site:3
docker image tag localhost:5000/alexdarbyshire-site:3 localhost:5000/alexdarbyshire-site:3

docker push localhost:5000/alexdarbyshire-site:3
docker push localhost:5000/alexdarbyshire-site:latest
```

#### Using secrets to pass our Cloudflare Tunnel token 
First, encode the token to base64 and make note of it. 
```bash
echo "insert_token_here" | base64 -w 0 
```
Base64 is not encryption, it is an encoding type and is not secure. We should treat our base64 token in the same way we treat our plaintext token.

Create a file called `secrets.yaml.example` with the following contents:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloudflared
data:
  token: insert_token_encoded_as_base64_here 
```

Make a copy and add the new file to `.gitignore` to exclude it from the git repo.
```bash
cp secrets.yaml.example secrets.yaml
echo "secrets.yaml" >> .gitignore
```

Edit secrets.yaml and add the base64 encoded token into it.

### Correct the Kubernetes Manifest for the cloudflared-hugo Image
The output of the Kompose command needed a fair bit of work. This process gives us an idea of its limitations. 

We will not use the files it created, below is a cleaned up combined version with the missing requirements added (service, port mappings, and updated image path).

Create a file called `cloudflared-hugo.yaml` with the following contents:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: cloudflared
  name: cloudflared-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cloudflared
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cloudflared
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - tunnel
        - --no-autoupdate
        - run
        - tunnel
        env:
          - name: TUNNEL_TOKEN
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: cloudflared
                key: token
        image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
        name: cloudflared
      restartPolicy: Always

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx-hugo
  name: nginx-hugo-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-hugo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-hugo
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: localhost:5000/alexdarbyshire-site:latest
        name: nginx-hugo
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80
      restartPolicy: Always

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-hugo
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx-hugo
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
---
```

The deploy folder should now look like this:
![image](10-ls-deploy-folder.png)

### Apply Manifests and Remove Docker Equivalents
Run the following from the `deploy` directory.
```bash
sudo k3s kubectl apply -f .
```
![image](11-apply-all-manifests.png)
That should do the trick.

#### Down the superseded docker compose stack
```bash
docker compose down
```

#### Confirm K3s resources are working
Success.
![image](12-success.png)

### Clean up 
We have some files we no longer need. 

```bash
cd ~/alexdarbyshire.com
rm .env .env.example 
rm docker-compose.yml
rm nginx-hugo-deployment.yaml cloudflared-deployment.yaml
```

#### Make a commit
Commit our code to the local repo once again.

Check no files including secrets will be committed by checking what will be committed.
```bash
git status
```

Then add and commit.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Migrate from Docker Compose to K3s"
```

## Done
Now we can start dreaming about the thing we will improve next.
